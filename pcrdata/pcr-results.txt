PCR Results

Five primer pairs were tested for detection of OrNV in isolates propogated in insect cell culture from AgResearch New Zealand. All five successfully detected OrNV.

PCR data indicate that OrNV is present in the Guam adult CRB population: 18% (10 of 47) gut samples dissected from field collected CRB tested positive for OrNV.

PCR data indicate that OrNV is present in the adult Taiwanese CRB population:  7% (5 of 67) gut samples dissected from field collected CRB tested positive for OrNV. 

PCR data indicate that virus found in Taiwanese adult beetles propogates in Guam adult CRB: 12% (5 of 41) Guam CRB dosed with Taiwanese gut preparations tested positive.
