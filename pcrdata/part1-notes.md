# Notes for Part 1

* Five primer pairs were tested on OrNV isolates V23B and Dug42 produced in insect cell culture at AgResearch New Zealand. 
All five of these primer pairs generated DNA fragments of the expected length.

* Gut samples from undosed field collected beetles from LIST were tested. Beetles collected from LIST tested positive for OrNV. 

* Gut samples from laboratory-dosed, field-collected beetles from Guam were tested. N of N beetles tested positive.
